# Testing the Player Controls Hiding Feature

## Quick Test Instructions

### 1. Setup the Extension
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable Developer mode
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `anti-spoil-extension` folder
4. Ensure the extension is enabled

### 2. Test on YouTube Video Player
1. **Navigate to any YouTube video** (e.g., https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q6eLSHcFE8)
2. **Click the extension icon** in the browser toolbar
3. **Look for the new "Video Player Controls" section** in the popup
4. **Click "Hide Player Controls"** button
5. **Expected Result**: 
   - Video duration should disappear from the player
   - Progress bar should become invisible
   - Time controls should be hidden

### 3. Test Toggle Functionality
1. **Click "Show Player Controls"** to toggle back
2. **Expected Result**: All controls should reappear
3. **Refresh the page**
4. **Expected Result**: Settings should persist (controls remain hidden/visible as set)

### 4. Test Independence from Blur Feature
1. **Toggle player controls ON** (hidden)
2. **Toggle blur feature** (if you have channels in your list)
3. **Expected Result**: Both features should work independently
4. **Player controls should remain hidden regardless of blur state**

## Elements That Should Be Hidden

When "Hide Player Controls" is enabled, these should disappear:
- ✅ **Video duration** (e.g., "10:45" in bottom-right)
- ✅ **Current time** (e.g., "2:30" in bottom-left)  
- ✅ **Progress bar** (red line showing video progress)
- ✅ **Time separator** (the "/" between current and total time)

## Troubleshooting

### If controls don't hide:
1. **Refresh the YouTube page** after enabling the extension
2. **Check console for errors** (F12 → Console)
3. **Try a different YouTube video** (some layouts may vary)
4. **Ensure you're on a video page** (not homepage/search results)

### If settings don't persist:
1. **Check chrome://extensions/** - ensure extension has storage permissions
2. **Try toggling the feature twice** to ensure it saves
3. **Check console for storage errors**

## Expected Console Messages

When working correctly, you should see:
```
Anti-Spoil Extension content script loading...
Anti-Spoil Extension initialized
Content script received message: {action: "toggle-player-controls"}
```

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New User
- Fresh extension install
- Default state should show "Hide Player Controls" button
- Player controls should be visible by default

### Scenario 2: Feature Toggle
- Enable → Player controls should hide immediately  
- Disable → Player controls should show immediately
- No page refresh required for changes

### Scenario 3: Cross-Page Persistence
- Enable on one video
- Navigate to different video
- Controls should remain hidden

### Scenario 4: Combined Features
- Add channels to blur list
- Enable both blur and player controls hiding
- Both features should work together without conflicts

## Browser DevTools Testing

Open DevTools and check that these elements have the `anti-spoil-player-controls-hidden` class:
```javascript
// Check hidden elements
document.querySelectorAll('.anti-spoil-player-controls-hidden').length
// Should return > 0 when feature is enabled

// Check specific elements
document.querySelector('.ytp-time-display')?.classList.contains('anti-spoil-player-controls-hidden')
document.querySelector('.ytp-progress-bar-container')?.classList.contains('anti-spoil-player-controls-hidden')
```

The new Player Controls feature is now ready for testing! It provides an additional layer of spoiler protection by hiding timing information from the video player interface.
