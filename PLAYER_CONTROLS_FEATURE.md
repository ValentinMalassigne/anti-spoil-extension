# Player Progress Protection Feature

The Anti-Spoil Extension now includes a new feature to hide the progress bar and replace video duration with "??" on the YouTube video player for videos from channels in your blur list.

## New Feature Overview

### What it does:
- Hides the progress bar/scrubber at the bottom of the video player **only for videos from channels in your list**
- Replaces the video duration display with "??" (e.g., `10:45` becomes `??:??`) **only for videos from channels in your list**
- **Keeps the current time visible** (e.g., `2:15` remains visible)
- **Keeps all other controls** (play/pause, volume, settings, etc.)
- **Works with the same channel list** as the blur feature

### How to use:
1. **Add channels to your blur list** first (same list used for both features)
2. **Navigate to any YouTube video page** from a channel in your list
3. **Click the extension icon** in your browser toolbar
4. **Use the "Toggle Player Protection" button** in the "Video Player Protection" section
5. **Toggle on/off as needed** - settings are saved automatically

## Technical Implementation

### New Settings:
- Added `hidePlayerControls: boolean` to the Settings interface
- This setting is stored persistently and syncs across devices

### New UI Controls:
- **"Video Player Controls" section** in the popup
- **Toggle button** to hide/show player controls
- **Status indicator** showing current state

### CSS Classes Applied:
- `.anti-spoil-player-controls-hidden` - Applied to progress bars (uses opacity: 0)
- Duration text replacement is handled directly in JavaScript

### Targeted Elements:
The extension modifies these YouTube player elements:
- `.ytp-progress-bar-container` - Progress bar container (hidden with opacity)
- `.ytp-scrubber-container` - Video scrubber (hidden with opacity)
- `.ytp-progress-bar-padding` - Progress bar padding (hidden with opacity)
- `.ytp-progress-list` - Progress bar list (hidden with opacity)
- `.ytp-time-duration` - Total duration text (replaced with `??:??`)

**Elements that remain visible:**
- `.ytp-time-current` - Current playback time (e.g., `2:15`)
- `.ytp-time-separator` - Time separator (`/`)
- All other control buttons (play/pause, volume, settings, fullscreen, etc.)

## User Experience

### Benefits:
- **Channel-specific protection** - Only affects videos from channels you choose
- **Prevents duration spoilers** - You won't accidentally see how much time is left for spoiler-prone content
- **Progress protection** - No visual indication of video progress for selected channels
- **Maintains usability** - Current time and all controls remain functional
- **Non-intrusive** - Only affects videos from channels in your list
- **Flexible control** - Easy to toggle on/off per need
- **Unified with blur feature** - Uses the same channel list for consistency

### Use Cases:
- **TV show channels** - Avoid knowing when episodes will end for channels that post full episodes
- **Gaming channels** - Don't spoil boss fight durations or completion times for specific gaming channels
- **Movie review channels** - Hide duration for channels that might spoil movie lengths
- **Educational series** - Focus on learning without time pressure for specific educational channels
- **Live streams/premieres** - Enjoy content without duration context for followed channels

## Testing the Feature

### Test Steps:
1. **Load the extension** in Chrome (chrome://extensions/)
2. **Add at least one channel** to your blur list (e.g., @TestChannel)
3. **Navigate to YouTube** and open a video from that channel
4. **Click the extension icon**
5. **Toggle "Player Protection"** - should hide duration/progress for videos from listed channels
6. **Navigate to a video from a different channel** (not in your list) - controls should remain visible
7. **Toggle again** - should restore controls for listed channels
8. **Refresh the page** - settings should persist

### Expected Behavior:
- ✅ Video duration text changes from `10:45` to `??:??` **only for videos from channels in your list**
- ✅ Progress bar becomes invisible **only for videos from channels in your list**
- ✅ Current time remains visible (e.g., `2:15 / ??:??`)
- ✅ Videos from channels **not in your list** show normal duration and progress
- ✅ All other controls remain functional (play, pause, volume, etc.)
- ✅ Settings persist across page loads
- ✅ Can toggle independently of blur feature
- ✅ Works alongside channel-based blurring

## Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome 88+** (Manifest V3 support)
- **Chromium-based browsers** (Edge, Opera, Brave)
- **Works on all YouTube layouts** (desktop, theater mode)

## Message API

### New Action:
```javascript
{
  action: 'toggle-player-controls',
  playerControlsHidden: boolean
}
```

### Response:
```javascript
{
  success: boolean,
  playerControlsHidden: boolean,
  error?: string
}
```

## Settings Structure

Updated settings object:
```json
{
  "blurEnabled": true,
  "channelList": ["@channel1", "@channel2"],
  "hidePlayerControls": false
}
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for this feature:
- **Selective hiding** - Choose which elements to hide (duration only, progress only, etc.)
- **Hover reveal** - Temporarily show controls on hover
- **Channel-specific settings** - Hide controls only for certain channels
- **Time-based hiding** - Hide controls only during certain parts of videos
- **Keyboard shortcuts** - Quick toggle with hotkeys

This feature works independently of the blur functionality and can be used separately or in combination with channel-based blurring for maximum spoiler protection!
